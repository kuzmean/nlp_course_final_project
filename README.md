# Toxic Comment Classification Project

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of automatically classifying comments as toxic or non-toxic. This model can be useful for online communication platforms, social networks, and news websites, helping to automatically filter out unwanted or harmful comments.

## Data

The data used for training and testing the model consists of a set of textual comments labeled as "toxic" and "non-toxic". The data is sourced from the Yandex Practicum project, which completely duplicates the dataset from Kaggle's "Toxic Comment Classification Challenge".

## Repository Files Description

1. **TF-IDF.ipynb**: This notebook contains code for training a classification model based on the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method. It implements the process of data preparation, model training, and performance evaluation.

2. **transformers.ipynb**: In this notebook, an alternative classification model is implemented using the Transformers library from Hugging Face. The model is based on a pre-trained BERT model or other architectures specialized in text processing.

Each notebook contains comments and explanations of the code to ensure understanding of the model training process and analysis of the results.
